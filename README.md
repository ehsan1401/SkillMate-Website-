  resulting in better **performance** and **SEO**.
- **Tailwind CSS** allows for **faster**, **lighter**, and more **efficient styling**.
- **TypeScript** ensures type safety and better maintainability across the codebase.
- **Ant Design** provides a polished, professional, and consistent UI component set.

## ⚙️ Server

The server side is built using **Nest.js** and **PostgreSQL (Psql)**.

- **Nest.js** provides a scalable, modular, and maintainable backend architecture.
- **PostgreSQL** is used for reliable and structured data management.
